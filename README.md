DiscoDeck allows you to use a native app to view all messages a Discord bot can see, across multiple channels and servers.

Allowing you to create customized feeds with per-channel filtering, to ensure you always see the most important messages.

This works through the Discord bot API, **ensure you have message priviliges enabled for your bot** for it to work.

It supports the following message types: Embeds, Regular Messages, Attachments, Images.

How's the latency? Better than the desktop application, much better than the web-app, negligible compared to the mobile apps.

Designed with support for iPads and Macs in compatibility mode. Not compatible with iPhones.

## Usage

You can either compile the project yourself, or use the Testflight version here: https://testflight.apple.com/join/X83Byd4X

Then paste your bots token, and then create your customized feeds :)
